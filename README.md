# Ceaser_Cipher
Cryptography deals with encrypting or encoding a piece of information (in a plain text) into a form that looks gibberish and makes little sense in ordinary language.
This encoded message(also called ciphertext) can then be decoded back into a plain text by the intended recipient using a decoding technique (often along with a private key) communicated to the end-user.

Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption technique.
Although Caesar Cipher is a very weak encryption technique and is rarely used today.
